# Maze-Runner
A player is inserted into a maze and it has to find the exit. If no exit is found, then it displays a message.  

How the program works:

  The program starts by reading the passed-in file that contains height and width of the maze, 
  the starting row and column coordinates of the player, and how the maze is graphically laid out. 
  
  Special characters:
    "#" - represents a wall 
    "o" - represents the exit
    
  After the program has finished reading the file, the player now starts traversing the maze(2d vector) until
  it finds the exit. If no exit is found, then displays a "No exit found" message.  
  
  *** The program decides which moves to take, the user only specifies which file they want to run(change the file name ) ****
